# ArthPi Home Server

A Raspberry Pi 4–based home server designed for reliable storage, media streaming, and automated health monitoring.

This project turns a Raspberry Pi into:

-  RAID1 mirrored storage (data redundancy)
-  Jellyfin media server
-  Samba network storage (Windows compatible)
-  Web-based file uploads (Filebrowser)
-  Docker-managed services
-  Automated disk & RAID health monitoring with email alerts

---

# Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 4B
- 2 × 750GB Seagate HDDs
- Blueendless HD05 dual-drive dock
- MicroSD card (OS only)

---

# System Architecture

## Storage Layer

- RAID Level: **RAID1 (Mirroring)**
- Device: `/dev/md0`
- Filesystem: `ext4`
- Mount point: `/mnt/raid`
- Auto-mount configured via UUID in `/etc/fstab`

RAID1 mirrors both disks.  
If one fails, the system continues running.

> RAID is redundancy, not backup.

---

## Directory Structure

```
/mnt/raid
├── media
│   ├── movies
│   └── series
│
└── docker
    ├── jellyfin
    │   ├── config
    │   └── cache
    └── filebrowser
        ├── config
        └── database
```

All important data lives on RAID — not on the SD card.
