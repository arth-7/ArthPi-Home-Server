Login if required.

### Step 2 – Sign In (If Prompted) Enter your server credentials:
- **Username:** `arth` - **Password:** (your Samba password) If this is your personal laptop, you can select
**Remember my credentials**. --- ### Step 3 – Upload Files You will see folders such as:
- `movies` - `series` Drag and drop your files into the correct folder. Wait until the copy process fully completes before closing the window. Your files are now stored on the server.
 ``` --- If you'd like, I can also add a small section on how to permanently map it as a drive (like `Z:`) so it looks cleaner and more professional.
